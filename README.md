# Python

A few changes will be needed to test python.py:  
1 - Change the directory of the output_1.txt inside the code and the input file can be used accordingly.  
2 - Change the output_2.txt directory to the same directory as output_1.txt or another one of preferrable choice.  

Note: VSCode was used to code and run python.py
